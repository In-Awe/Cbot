 * XRP/USDT 1-Second Trader Bot
 * Strategy: 'Adaptive Impulse Catcher'
 * Version: 1.2 (XRP Optimized with Volatility Adaptation)
 *
 * DISCLAIMER: This script is for educational and illustrative purposes only.
 * High-frequency trading involves significant risk. You are solely responsible 
 * for any financial losses.
 *
 * --- STRATEGY OVERVIEW ---
 * This version adapts to market volatility to improve efficiency. It aims to 
 * trade more in stable conditions and become more selective during high 
 * volatility, addressing the issue of missed trades in calmer periods.
 *
 * 1.  VOLATILITY ANALYSIS: The bot calculates price volatility (standard deviation)
 *     over the last 5 minutes (300 seconds).
 *
 * 2.  DYNAMIC THRESHOLDS: The 'PRICE_CHANGE_THRESHOLD' is no longer fixed. It
 *     starts at a lower base value (0.09%) and increases automatically as market
 *     volatility rises. This allows the bot to catch smaller impulses in quiet
 *     markets while avoiding false signals during chaotic periods.
 *
 * 3.  VOLUME & CONFIDENCE: The volume spike factor and confidence score
 *     thresholds have been slightly lowered to increase sensitivity, balanced by
 *     the new dynamic price threshold.
 *
 * --- EXECUTION LOGIC ---
 * - The bot analyzes market conditions and adjusts its own parameters every tick.
 * - A trade is triggered if an impulse's confidence score exceeds 72 and it
 *   passes the dynamically-adjusted price and volume checks.
